Bro Bang Rules:

Gameplay:

The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are scored by hitting coins/pins, so-called bangs. For every 10 bangs you raise up one level. The speed of the pin movement increases during the game. If you mis-hit, you lose one of 3 hearts.

Within the game there are so-called simple rounds, multi rounds and bonus waves.

Depending of the actual round, bangs can have multipliers.

In single rounds every bang count as one point.

In multi rounds coin constellations can generate additional points. Bring coins into a line of 3 or 5 and receive this amount as additional points.

Within bonus waves, bangs are multiplied by the current level.

If you miss 5 bonus waves to generate bangs, you will be forced to execute 5 bangs within forced waves. Forced waves will always be a little faster as regular bonus waves.

Rankings:

To access the rankings, you must log in with your Hive username and your CCCEO Access Code (as long as required).

The speed at which you earn bangs is compared with the average speed of other players. If you fall massively below the average, you have either dawdled too long, spent too long calculating which pin combinations are best not to smash or are trying to gain an advantage by playing extremely slowly. In either case, the game machine will warn you - you should simply step on the gas a little more.
